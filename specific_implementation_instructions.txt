here are some additional specific implementatiotion instructions and guidelines:

1. all python scripts you write must be fully self-contained:
- the script must fully manage all venvs. that includes cleaning up after running.
- the script must do all neccessary pip installs by itself.

2. be verbose in both commenting and terminal output. always note/comment the version number at the start of the script, so the user doesn't accidently copy&paste the wrong version.

3. always handle errors gracefully and robustly.

4. always handle ctrl+c gracefully and robustly.

5. if you iterate over any script; always update the full script. code snippets only are not enough.

6. never call any script the "final" script.

7. you know that systems and apis are constantly changing and take that into account in your design aprpproach. you never just conjure methods, approaches and facts from your internal understanding, but rather, you will always research the current, relevant documentation fully (for example, research the current twitch api documentation to obtain an understanding about access tokens' format and how they are handled, do not just assume that they will be in oauth: format).

8. we will initially always be working with free-to-use models on openrouter.ai. be very considerate and polite in using these. always use as little parrallel/concurrent model calls as possible. if at all possible, wait at least one second between any two model calls.

9. all API keys must be stored in a .env file and always be handled in a secure way.

10. all prompts used within the application/script/agent must be stored in external files. one file per prompt.

11. all other settings (llm model, temperature, other settings) should be stored in one external configuration file.
